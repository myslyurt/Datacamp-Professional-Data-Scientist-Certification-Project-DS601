# Datacamp Professional Data Scientist Certification Project DS601
The professional data scientist certification 2024 end-to-end project DS601 by Datacamp

The final stage of the certification required the individual to complete a practical exam. This certification stage is graded manually and stringently by our data scientist experts.

The practical exam is split into two parts:

1. Technical report:
In the case of the technical report, the audience is a data science manager. It can be considered that the work is being presented to show how the task has been approached, why certain actions were taken, and how the work helps to solve the problem defined. There is no one right answer.
